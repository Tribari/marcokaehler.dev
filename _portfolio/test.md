## Description

On behalf of the DLR (German Aerospace Center) a social network based on a Joomla installation was created. The system will continue to be managed and administered. Regular web meetings with people from DLR, NASA, JAXA, and other IFAR members coordinate the further development.

I administrate all the parts of the page (hosting, layout,functionality). Development, implementation and further changes are all done by myself.

In january 2017 I have published the first mobile application for IFARlink. It can be downloaded for Android and IOS.
