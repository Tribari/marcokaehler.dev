I am a **software developer** who has grown up with the computer. After school I have completed an apprenticeship as a **Computer Science Expert for Software Development (IHK)** at Siemens AG. Completing apprenticeship I started studying media computer science.

Early on, I realized that the best way to **develop knowledge** is an **autodidactic way**, with immediate **practical relevance**. As a child of the generation Google I know how to fix a lack of knowledge and how I can use this as an advantage for myself. My approach is **solution-oriented and creative nature**. I wanted to combine my **interest in design and art** with my **knowledge of software development** â€“ I have started my own business as a **webdesigner**.

People appreaciate my **social, empathic and friendly** character. I have a **positive attitude** and am always open to new things. Knowing my own limits I am not too shy to ask for help if needed. **Cohesion and friendliness** in a team are **important to me**.
