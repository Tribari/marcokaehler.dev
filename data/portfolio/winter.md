## Description
My internet agency was commissioned by Mr. Christoph Winter to develop a corporate design. Mr. Winter planned to found a new company that would offer training courses on the subject of store management.

For his project, I first worked out a rough corporate design guideline. This includes a color setting, selected fonts and display rules. Then I have for Mr. Winter designed a logo.

The website of the store management trainer was implemented with the help of Wordpress and the tool Elementor. The focus here was on simple user guidance and a sales-stimulating effect.

In addition to the website, I also created various print designs. Among other things, his business cards, a prospectus, a certificate template, pens and an invoice template were created.
