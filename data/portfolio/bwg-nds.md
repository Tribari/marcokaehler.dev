## Description

The Scientific Society of Bruswick (BWG) needed a proper solution for managing it members. The existing solution with excel files did not work anymore. So the BWG contacted me with requirements of a future management platform.

I planned and developed a small and lightweight platform based on the PHP Laravel framework. My focus was a small and easy to use administration panel.

## Used Skills

* UX/UI Design for administration interface
* PHP Laravel Framework
* MySQL Database layout & connection
* Data migration from existing excel files to new platform
