## Description

The Realschule Vorsfelde in Wolfsburg has a website based on Joomla. Unfortunately, the site was outdated in the meantime and the installed CMS was no longer up to date. So the secondary school asked me to modernize the site both technically and visually.

My main focus was on being able to take over the existing content. I was able to update Joomla to the latest version as well as the installed plugins. Furthermore, I have created a new, more modern design in the form of a template, as requested by the school management.

## Used Skills

* Joomla Maintenance
* Joomla Template-Development
* Migration of existing content
