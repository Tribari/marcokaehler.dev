## Description
The homepage is currently being completely revamped for IFAR. This includes the members being able to manage themselves as much as possible. Furthermore, the internally accessible databases are being integrated into the new system so that everything can be managed centrally via one platform in the future.
The system is already functionally in use for the databases, and the migration of the content for the live launch as a homepage is in progress.
