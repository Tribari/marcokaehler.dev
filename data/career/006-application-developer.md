With the completion of my training as a computer science expert, Siemens AG offered me a full-time job as an application developer and computer service technician.

My main task was the development and further development of loading tools for the software of railway interlocking systems. With the help of the programs I developed, current software versions were flashed onto the interlockings. In the development I worked exclusively with the programming language C++. The QT framework was also used to create a visual interface, which is where I first encountered the signal slot principle.
