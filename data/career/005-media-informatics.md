In addition to my job at Siemens, I started studying media informatics. Unfortunately, I realized very quickly that the course contained hardly any knowledge worth mentioning that I did not already know from my training as a computer science expert. So I took everything that was relevant to me with me, such as the media design courses. I also learned the programming language JAVA for two semesters.
