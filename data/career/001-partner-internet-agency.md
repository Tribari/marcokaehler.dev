I had the opportunity to join the internet agency K채hler as a partner. Now that I've been able to gain professional experience at Siemens AG for a number of years, I've decided to resign and take the next step in my career.

At the internet agency K채hler I was able to perfectly combine my skills as a software developer and my newly acquired knowledge in the field of media design. I am able to handle projects of various sizes and have a lot of variety. My main task is to look after customers, create and design websites and develop individual requests.

I now run the internet agency part-time if required. Over the years I've taken on a few jobs on the side, as this gave me the opportunity to work more in a team again.
