Since my business partner is slowly withdrawing from the joint company to retire, I made the decision in 2017 to look for a job as a developer again. I found a part-time job at the subsidiary of Deutsche Messe AG. Here primarily my knowledge in PHP and web development was asked.

Together with a team, I maintained Deutsche Messe AG's exhibitor management system and implemented requirements for further development. Furthermore, with my experience in Wordpress and web development in general, I was able to contribute a lot to consulting for future projects.

Unfortunately, the subsidiary was closed very suddenly due to the decision of the parent company, Deutsche Messe AG. As a result, Deutsche Messe Interactive GmBH ceased operations in mid-2018.
