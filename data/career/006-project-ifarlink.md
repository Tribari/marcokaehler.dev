During my work as a partner at the internet agency KÃ¤hler, I was able to win the German Aerospace Center (DLR) as a long-term customer. A social network based on the CMS Joomla was developed on behalf of DLR. Furthermore, the portal has been expanded to include several individual technology databases. In recent years, a separate app has also been developed, which is available for iOS and Android.

The social network platform is managed and maintained by me and in consultation with the DLR and other space organizations such as NASA, NRC, JAXA and many more, it is constantly being further developed. The project has been running since 2013 and is renewed on an annual basis. Every year, a different space organization provides the chair man - accordingly, new ideas and suggestions for further development are constantly being generated.
