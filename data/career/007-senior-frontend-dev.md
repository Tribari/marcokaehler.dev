After the sudden business closure at my previous employer, I looked for a new part-time job. I found this at multi-media-magement GmbH. Here I was hired to support the development team as a senior frontend developer.
Since the company was in a strong growth phase at that time, my area of responsibility changed very quickly from working as a developer to working as a technical product owner. I have only done a few development activities here. However, I came into contact with the Javascript framework Vue.js and was able to learn a lot about the workflow with Javascript-based web applications.
As a technical product owner, I received customer requirements and communicated and evaluated them with the management and the development team. I really liked the work as a connecting and mediating element of the workflow.
