{"pageProps":{"content":"<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>On behalf of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) the project IFARlink was started in 2013. IFARlink is a social network platform with the help of which prospective PhDs from the field of research and administration in the aerospace sector can network worldwide. The entire project was brought to life by the so-called IFAR members. IFAR is an association of various aerospace organizations worldwide - including NASA, DLR, JAXA and many more.</p>\n<p>When the project started in 2013, my main task was initially to advise and plan the implementation of the project. In consultation with the organizations involved, the requirements were defined and a first prototype was developed. The complete technical development was done by me. For this I used the CMS Joomla as a basis and extended it with the required functionalities. In addition to the functions for a social network, various technology databases were implemented.</p>\n<p>Since its completion, the project has been continuously developed. There are regular meetings for further development with changing members of IFAR - e.g. NASA, JAXA, NRC, DLR. The newly requested functions are evaluated by me and analyzed in terms of feasibility. If the decision to carry it out has been given by IFAR, I will take care of the development and implementation.</p>\n<p>In addition to further development, I also take care of the ongoing operation of IFARlink. This includes hosting the website, as well as regular updates and function tests.\nAn iOS and Android app has also been available since 2017, which is connected via a specially developed API. The app was implemented by me according to the wishes of IFAR. For cost and time reasons, I used the C# Xamarin Framework for this.</p>\n<h2>Used skills</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Joomla Installation and Administration</li>\n<li>Joomla Template- and Component-Development</li>\n<li>PHP for individual requirements like technology database development</li>\n<li>MySQL for Joomla and individual requirements</li>\n<li>JQuery for individual requirements</li>\n<li>API-Development for App-Access</li>\n<li>App-Development with C# &#x26; Xamarin</li>\n</ul>\n","title":"IFarlink - Aerospace Social Network","url":"https://www.ifarlink.aero/","metaTitle":"Project IFARlink | Marco KÃ¤hler","metaDescription":"IFARlink is a network for IFAR members and associated universities in aviation research.","metaKeywords":"Joomla Development, Joomla Plugin-Development, Joomla Template-Development, PHP Development","imageUrl":"/images/ifarlink.jpeg","images":["/images/ifarlink/IFARLink_App_1.jpeg","/images/ifarlink/IFARLink_App_2.jpeg","/images/ifarlink/IFARLink_Groups.jpeg","/images/ifarlink/IFARLink_News.jpeg"]},"__N_SSG":true}
